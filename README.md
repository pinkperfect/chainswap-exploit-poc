# ChainSwap exploit PoC

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

This is a proof-of-concept exploit for the [attacks that hit multiple ChainSwap contracts in July 2021](https://chain-swap.medium.com/chainswap-exploit-11-july-2021-post-mortem-6e4e346e5a32).

The exploit included here (kind of) replicates a series of transactions executed by [an EOA](https://etherscan.io/address/0xeda5066780de29d00dfb54581a707ef6f52d8113) targetting the contract [`0xc5185d2c68aaa7c5f0921948f8135d01510d647f`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc5185d2c68aaa7c5f0921948f8135d01510d647f) on Ethereum mainnet. The first of similar transactions is [`0x9c190629774f999f0b833505e35925b91330dbd5ebb5f1eba214494288919cce`](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9c190629774f999f0b833505e35925b91330dbd5ebb5f1eba214494288919cce).

## Install

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env`, and include your API key for https://archivenode.io.

## Run

You can run the script with `node scripts/exploit.js`. Everything will be executed against a local fork of mainnet starting at block 12801487.

## Details

I must say that the documentation on ChainSwap is scarce, the code doesn't have docstrings, the architecture is unclear, some contracts are verified while others are not. Their [GitHub](https://github.com/chainswap/contracts) doesn't help that much either, at least at the moment of writing. So take the following with a pinch of salt, as I might not be as technically accurate as I'd like to.

As a proof of concept, this script just focuses on reproducing an attack to a single proxy contract deployed on Ethereum mainnet at `0xc5185d2c68aaa7c5f0921948f8135d01510d647f`. In reality the attacker actually targeted multiple contracts across different chains in quite a large number of transactions. I haven't reviewed them all, but the ones I have would all follow a similar attack vector to the one presented here.

Regardless of whatever ChainSwap intends to do and its architecture, we can just focus on a couple of fundamental aspects to understand the exploit.

In summary, the attacker found an execution path to steal tokens deposited in the contract (for this PoC, tokens are [FAIR](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9b20dabcec77f6289113e61893f7beefaeb1990a)).

The victim contract has a [`receive(uint256,address,uint256,uint256,(address,uint8,bytes32,bytes32)[])` function](https://www.4byte.directory/signatures/?bytes4_signature=0xa653d60c) that (I presume) is intended for anyone to provide proof, by calling the function, that privileged "signatory" accounts have approved the release of some amount of tokens out of the contract to be sent to a specified address.

Each signatory has a quota of tokens that is authorized to release at a certain time, which is given by the `authQuotaOf(address)` getter function. There's no explicit whitelisting of signatories, and anyone can call the `receive` function. If _everything worked well_, as soon as you'd call `receive` passing signatures of a signatory that hasn't previously been authorized a quota of tokens, the call would simply revert.

But that wasn't the case.

The fundamental problem was that _any_ signatory would be assumed to start with a default, positive, quota. In the case of this PoC, we see that the default for any signatory is 1.2 M FAIR tokens. This means that anyone can call the `receive` function, provide whatever valid signatures they want (just following a required format), and take out up to 1.2 M FAIR tokens in a single call. This can be repeated multiple times until the contract runs out of tokens - which is exactly what the attacker did.
